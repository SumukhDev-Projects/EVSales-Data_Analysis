# Global-EV_Sales-Data_Analysis

# Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (Global EV Dataset.ipynb) that performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to global electric vehicle (EV) sales, stocks, and trends over the years. The analysis explores EV sales and stock trends globally, compares different EV powertrains (BEV vs. PHEV), and examines regional differences in EV adoption.

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 2,776 entries with 8 columns, providing information on electric vehicles (EVs) across various regions and categories. Here's a brief overview of the columns in the dataset:

Region: The geographical region or country.

Category: The data category, such as historical data or projections.

Parameter: Specific parameters are being measured, such as EV stock, EV stock share, or EV sales share.

Mode: The type of vehicles considered, such as cars.

EV type: The powertrain type, like BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) or EV (general electric vehicle category).

Year: The year the data was recorded.

Unit: The units of measurement, e.g., vehicles, percent.

Value: The numeric values corresponding to the parameter being measured.

The dataset includes data from the year 2010 to 2024. The value column, which seems to be the primary metric of interest, spans a wide range, suggesting a diverse set of measurements from percentages to actual vehicle counts. The data appears to cover various aspects of the EV market, including sales, market share, and overall stock.
